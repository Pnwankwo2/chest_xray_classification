# Milking the Data
## Milk Production Prediction
The Project Goal is to build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to accurately predict the average milk yield of cows based on environmental and lactation factors. The envirionmental factors are temperature, humidity, cold stress, precipitation. The lactation factors are lactation number, calving date, first record date

1. Dataset - Understanding the dataset:
cow and lactation cycle: lactation number, date of calving, date of first record of calv in the alp, average quantity of milk (measured in kilograms).
Environmental conditions: Temperature Humidity Index (THI) averaged over 3 and 30 days, Cold Stress Index (CSI) averaged over 3 and 30 days, precipitation during Spring.

the average quantity of milk is the defined target column.

2. Data Preprocessing:

Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values and outliers.
Encode categorical features if necessary.
Normalize or standardize numerical features.
Prepare the data for training and testing.
