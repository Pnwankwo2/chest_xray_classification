# Milking the Data
## Milk Production Prediction
The Project Goal is to build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the average milk yield of cows based on environmental and lactation factors.

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values and outliers.
Encode categorical features if necessary.
Normalize or standardize numerical features.
Prepare the data for training and testing.
