# Milking the Data
## Milk Production Prediction
The Project Goal is to build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the average milk yield of cows based on environmental and lactation factors.


Step 1: Dataset Exploration and Preprocessing
Exploration of Data:

First, we need to examine the data to understand its structure and type. The dataset consists of the following features:

newid: A unique identifier for each instance.
lact_num: The lactation number.
calv_date: The date of calving.
alp_date: The date of the animal's first lactation.
avg_milk: The average milk yield.
avg_thi3: Average THI (Temperature-Humidity Index) for 3 days.
avg_csi3: Average CSI (Climate Stress Index) for 3 days.
avg_thi30: Average THI for 30 days.
avg_csi30: Average CSI for 30 days.
avg_precspring: Average precipitation during the spring season.
